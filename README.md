# Cfm-id
github based version of cfmid. Due to the Wur servers not having a way to pull svn projects.

cfm is not made by me go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/cfm-id/ for more info
If you have svn use "svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/cfm-id/code/cfm cfm" to obtain the code

I've added a folder with the pretrained models and a config file as well.
